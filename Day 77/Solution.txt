Output: d
Explanation: xyz[3][4] is a 2d array with 3 rows and each row has 4 characters in each row. ptr pointer will point towards the starting address of array xyz. xyz[1] will point towards the 2nd row, (xyz[1] + 1) will point towards 2nd row first character. (*(xyz[1] + 1) will dereference and the output will be d.
