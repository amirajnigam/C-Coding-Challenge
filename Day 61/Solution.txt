Output: 10100 
Reason: This program is an example to convert a decimal number into an equivalent binary number.
 Here, the function call itself which is an example of direct recursion(function calls itself). 
Here, it is the base condition that will stop the recursion. 

n = 20, output = 0 
n = 10, output = 0 
n = 5, output = 1 
n = 2, output = 0 
n = 1, output = 1(base condition, print 1)
Recursion function uses the call stack. When a program calls a function, that function goes on the top of the stack. It will print in the LIFO pattern. Final Output: 10100
