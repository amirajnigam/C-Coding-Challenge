Output: a=11,b=22,largest=21
Reason: Macro named LARGEST is replaced with macro body in pre processing stage i.e, (a++>=b++)?a++:b++ which is ternary operator
gives output a++ if condition is true else gives b++ value.So now (10>=20)?11:21 in which condition is false so b++ value is assigned
to l i.e,21 and its post increment so later b value become 22
