Output: -32
Reason: strcmp() compares the two strings lexicographically means it starts comparison character by character
starting from the first character until the characters in both strings are equal or a NULL character is encountered.
The ASCII value of S is 83 and the ASCII value of s is 115. A negative value will be returned when the first not 
matching character in the left string has lesser ASCII value than the corresponding character in the right string.
