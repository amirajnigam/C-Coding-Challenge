Output: 2 3 5 6
Reason: (*CDAC)[3] is a pointer to an array of 3 integers.
(*CDAC)[3] = {1,2,3}
Initially CDAC pointer will point towards the 1st row of Shivam.
(*CDAC)[1] = 2,
(*CDAC)[2] = 3
 
Now, ++CDAC will point towards the 2nd row of Shivam i.e.
(*CDAC)[3] = {4,5,6}
(*CDAC)[1] = 5
(*CDAC)[2] = 6
