Output: (null), Hello
Reason: Embedded(void) will return some garbage value because char str[] is a local variable in the Embedded function.
It will be destroyed once it reaches the end of the function.
 
IoT(void) will return Hello because char* str is pointing towards the address of the string "Hello". 
The IoT function has char* return data type,so it will return the value at that memory location.

The dangling pointer situation has been created in Embedded function. This problem can be solved by declaring
char str[] as the static variable(static char str[]) then the output will be Hello,Hello
