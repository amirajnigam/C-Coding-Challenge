Output: #ShivamCDAC 10
Reason: malloc(0) will return either a null pointer or a unique pointer that can be successfully passed to free().
in this case, memory has been allocated to the piBuffer, which means that the malloc is giving a unique pointer that
is passed to free().

fprintf() function
Syntax: int fprintf(FILE *fp, const char *format [, argument, ...] );

The fprintf() function is same as printf() but instead of writing data to the console, it writes formatted data into the file. Almost all the arguments of fprintf() function is same as printf() function except it has an additional argument which is a file pointer to the file where the formatted output will be written. On success, it returns the total number of characters written to the file. On error, it returns EOF.
