Output: 8,garbage value
Reason: In CDAC function Shiv is pointing towards the starting address of loc_arr[] i.e. Shiv[0] = loc_arr[0]
Now, Shiv++ will point towards the 1st element of loc_arr[] i.e. Shiv[0] = loc_arr[1]

Shiv[0]= loc_arr[0] = 7
Shiv[1] = loc_arr[1] = 8
Shiv[3] = loc_arr[2] = garbage value
