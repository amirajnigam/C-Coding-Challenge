 Output: Compilation Error
Reason: Static variables can only be initialized using constant literals. All objects with static storage duration must be
initialized (set to their initial values) before execution of main() starts. So a value which is not known at translation time
cannot be used for initialization of static variables.

If we declare static int i = 50; then we will get output: value of i = 50
