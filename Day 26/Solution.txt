Output: #ShivamCDAC4
Reason: Function CDAC() has returned type int, printf() return the total number of character printed. When CDAC()
is called it will print #ShivamCDAC. Now, the main() printf will return the number of characters printed by the last printf
in CDAC() i.e. 4. Hence, the output will be #ShivamCDAC4
