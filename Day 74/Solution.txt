Output: #ShivamCDAC infinite times

Reason: the do-while loop is used, the loop will be executed once without checking the termination condition.

Printf function execution will start from right to left. 


i = 0
i++; // i = 1
j = i--// j = 1 
i = 0

j will be always one, Hence the loop will execute for infinite times.
