Output:2 35 6
Reason: a[][3] is a 2D array which has 2 rows. Each row has 3 elements = {{1,2,3},{4,5,6}}
(*ptr)[3] -> ptr pointer will point towards the starting address of the first element of the first row.
(*ptr)[1] = 2 and (*ptr)[2] = 3
++ptr: Now ptr will point towards the starting elements of the second row
(*ptr)[1] = 5 and(*ptr)[2]= 6
