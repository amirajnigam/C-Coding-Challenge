Ans: Output: -1 5
Reason: In union, all elements share the same memory location. In union CDAC, bit fields are used to use memory
more efficiently. The output comes to be negative. Value 3 is assigned in 2 bit signed integer which is equal to 11 in binary. The MSB is at 1, so it's a negative number and we need to calculate 2's complement of the binary number to get the actual value. By
calculating 2's complement, we will get 01 which is equivalent to decimal number 1, and since it was a negative number we will
get -1. Whereas for 5, it is declared with 3 bit unsigned int data type which will be 101 in binary.Â
